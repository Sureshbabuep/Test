Our mission

Helping Hands Community serves individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food insecurity, using technology to empower community organizations and local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in need.

How we help

We partner with food banks to provide their constituents home delivery. Our technology platform connects our partners that serve residents in need with delivery partners and local volunteers to deliver food and supplies to their homes.
